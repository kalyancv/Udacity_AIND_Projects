## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

	```
2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 
3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.
5. Obtain the necessary Python packages, and switch Keras backend to Tensorflow.  
	
	For __Mac/OSX__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-mac.yml

	```

	For __Windows__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-windows.yml
		activate aind-dog
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
6. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```


## Amazon Web Services

Instead of training your model on a local CPU (or GPU), you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.  Please refer to the Udacity instructions for setting up a GPU instance for this project.

#### Step 1: Detect Humans
 	Haar cascades for face detection are an appropriate technique for human detection.

#### Step 2: Detect Dogs
 	The first 100 images in the dog and human face datasets with a detected dog.       

#### Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
 	Specifies a CNN architecture.
 	Train the Model 
 	Test the Model

#### Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
	Downloads the bottleneck features corresponding to one of the Keras pre-trained models (VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception, or Xception).
	Specifies a model architecture.
	Compiles the architecture by specifying the loss function and optimizer. 
	Train the Model uses model checkpointing to train the model and saves the model with the best validation loss. 
	Load the Model with the Best Validation Loss, loads the model weights that attained the least validation loss.
	Test the Model, Accuracy on the test set is 60% or greater. 
	Predict Dog Breed with the Model, includes a function that takes a file path to an image as input and returns the dog breed that is predicted by the CNN. 

#### Step 6: Write your Algorithm

	Write your Algorithm, uses the CNN from Step 5 to detect dog breed.  Different output for each detected image type (dog, human, other) and provides either predicted actual (or resembling) dog breed.

#### Step 7: Test your Algorithm
	Test the Algorithm on Sample Images!, at least 6 images, including at least two human and two dog images. |

## Suggestions to Make your Project Stand Out!

	(Presented in no particular order ...)

#### (1) Augment the Training Data 

	[Augmenting the training and/or validation set](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) might help improve model performance. 

#### (2) Turn your Algorithm into a Web App

	Turn the code into a web app using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [web.py](http://webpy.org/docs/0.3/tutorial)!  

#### (3) Overlay Dog Ears on Detected Human Heads

	Overlay a Snapchat-like filter with dog ears on detected human heads.  You can determine where to place the ears through the use of the OpenCV face detector, which returns a bounding box for the face.  If you would also like to overlay a dog nose filter, some nice tutorials for facial keypoints detection exist [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/details/deep-learning-tutorial).

#### (4) Add Functionality for Dog Mutts

	Currently, if a dog appears 51% German Shephard and 49% poodle, only the German Shephard breed is returned.  The algorithm is currently guaranteed to fail for every mixed breed dog.  Of course, if a dog is predicted as 99.5% Labrador, it is still worthwhile to round this to 100% and return a single breed; so, you will have to find a nice balance.  

#### (5) Experiment with Multiple Dog/Human Detectors

	Perform a systematic evaluation of various methods for detecting humans and dogs in images.  Provide improved methodology for the `face_detector` and `dog_detector` functions.
